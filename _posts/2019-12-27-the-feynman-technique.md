title: The Feynman Technique
---

The Feynman technique is a learning model for new concepts. This is the technique that anyone can apply and adapt to learning processes easily. 

This technique is introduced by famous physicist Richard Feynman. It’s quite simple and probably the best way to learn something new.

You know that memorizing is not the way of learning. Once you discover something, you would like to learn the reasoning or the idea behind the concept. If you’re the one, this is the technique that elevates your learning process.

Here are the major steps: 

## 1. Pick a topic
You should pick a subject or concept that you're interested in. Learn what the concept is and ask questions around the concept. These questions are 5W 1H questions.

It's not easy to learn everything at the first attempt. Therefore, you may use a paper to write down the things and invest some time for learning.

When you feel fine, move to the next step.

## 2. Teach it

In this step, you should explain the concept to someone else. It's just like presenting to someone.

While explaining things, you will discover some gaps in your knowledge. These are the areas you should pay attention to. Please take notes when you discover them.

This step reveals all the gaps in your knowledge, and it's the key step of this learning process. It tells you what areas should be revised and focused.

## 3. Fill the gaps

In the previous step, you discovered the gaps and your notes. Now, it is high time for filling those gaps in your knowledge and digging deep.

You should concentrate on the areas that you are lacking knowledge.

## 4. Review

Review all the things in your hand and the concept you understand. Make sure that you have simple words/sentences while describing.

If you feel uncomfortable with your understanding, words and your analogy, please make those things simple.

Once you simplify it, you're good to go!

## Personal Thoughts

This is the technique that I discovered in my senior year at university. Nowadays, I mostly find myself describing things to my colleagues, friends and my family. It really made a significant effect on my learning process.

> “You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird... So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing — that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.” - Richard Feynman

Learning is not memorizing, but profoundly an understanding of the whole concept and explaining the concept in a simple manner.

Feynman's approach is the best one that I've ever seen.
