title: At the edge of a decision
---

A single decision has a significant effect of someone’s life. It may change and affect everything. Actually, our lives are surrounded by decisions. Our environment is also affected by our decisions. Making a decision can be the hardest action of our lives.

Some people may not be aware of the results of their decisions. Every single decision has a correlation with its result. Our decision making process has a direct impact on results and each decision is a breakpoint. We make decisions when circumstances change or life pushes us to make them. However, every time we’re supposed to make a decision, we encounter two separated paths leading to different consequences. Each path goes to another way and may have different results.

All actions come with decisions and every decision is hard to make. What we did, how we achieved or failed in the past, it was all about our decisions. We made those decisions in hard circumstances but we did it. Those challenges led us to somewhere where we are today. We’re still battling for our goals. We may have lost our strength or faith. What we should have learnt from our decisions is to go with the path we most want and not to hesitate.

We are not capable of estimating the results of our decisions. That’s why we feel ourselves as stuck and desperate when we need to make an important decision. We worry too much. We try to foresee the results of our decisions and sometimes, it is not possible to predict the results. Worries will not change the results.
Some of us may think that making a decision is easy but the hardest part is to take an action. If we hesitate to take an action, we will not be the designator of the circumstances in our lives. Hence, a decision should come with its action.

Decision making seems to be hard and sometimes it can be the hardest part when you have multiple options. We are encircled with thoughts, decisions and ideas. Why we hesitate, worry and predict is that we always want the best one.

We have to believe that if one’s goal is concrete and solid, every chosen path will lead to that goal in the end.
